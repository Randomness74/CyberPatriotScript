# CyberPatriotScript
This is my Linux script for CyberPatriot, a national youth cyber defense competition. I have worked on this since I started competing in my freshman year, and it has improved significantly compared to its original state.

The main script file is *BashScript.sh*, which runs the other files in the repository. This script covers the following:
* Password policy
* Updates
* File permissions
* Firefox settings
* Updates
* Networking configuration
* Removing prohibited files/software
* Managing services
* Malware checks
* Managing common services (SSH, FTP, Apache, NGINX, Samba)
